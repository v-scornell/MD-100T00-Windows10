## Summary
In this exercise you will learn how configure File History and use it to restore previous versions of a file or folder. 

## Exercise 1: Configure File History

### Scenario

You need to ensure that users can recover deleted files stored in the Documents library on their local workstations. You decide to validate the File History feature using SEA-CL2. You will create a shared folder on SEA-SVR1 named FileHistory that will be used as a central location to store file history data.

2.  Select the **File Explorer** icon on the taskbar and in the navigation pane, select **Local Disk (C:)**.
3.  In File Explorer, in the details pane, right-click an empty space, point to **New**, and then select **Folder**. Type **FileHistory** as the folder name, and then press Enter.
4.  Right-click the **FileHistory** folder, and then select **Properties**.

2.  On **SEA-CL2**, on the taskbar, select the **File Explorer** icon.
3.  In File Explorer, in the navigation pane, expand **This PC**, and then select **Documents**. In the details pane, right-click an empty space, point to **New**, select **Text Document**, and then enter **Report** as the name of the file.
4.  Double-click **Report.txt**, and in Notepad, type **This is a report**. Close the Notepad file, and then select **Save** to save the changes.

15.  File Explorer opens. Verify that Report.txt has been recovered to the original location. Double-click **Report.txt**, confirm that it contains the text that you typed, close Notepad, and then close File Explorer.
16.  In the Report.txt – File History window, on the left of the address box, select the upward-pointing arrow twice.
17.  Review the folders and libraries that File History is protecting, and confirm that the a folder named Data and a folder named Reports are not among them. 
18.  Close the Home – File History window.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have successfully configured File History and validated a successful recovery of a protected file.


## Exercise 2: Protect Additional Data

### Scenario

An additional request has been made to protect specific files being added to SEA-CL2. A script has been provided named CopyUserData.bat to be used to create the intended folders and copy the required data. The *Data* folder needs to be added to the document library, but both the *Data* and *Reports* folder must both be protected by File History. 

### Task 1: Run the CopyUserData script

1.  On **SEA-CL2**, in File Explorer, browse to **\\\\SEA-DC1\\labfiles\\Support\\**.
    
2.  In the content pane, double-click **CopyUserData** to copy lab files to the local client.
    
3.  In File Explorer, in the navigation pane, expand **Local Disk (C:)**, and then select **Data**. In the details pane, right-click **Sales.txt**, select **Properties**, select the **Previous Versions** tab, confirm that there are no previous versions available, and then select **OK**. 

### Task 2: Configure Additional Folders

1.  In the navigation pane, right-click **Data**, select **Include in library**, and then select **Documents**. As File History protects the Documents library, File History is now also protecting the Data folder.
    
2.  In File Explorer, in the navigation pane, select **Reports**. In the details pane, right-click **Report.txt**, select **Properties**, select the **Previous Versions** tab, confirm that there are no previous versions available, and then select **OK**.
    
3.  On the taskbar, in the **Type here to search** box, enter **file history**, and then select **Backup settings**.
    
4.  In the **Settings** window, in the **Back up using File History** section, select **More options**.
    
5.  On the **Backup options** page, in the **Back up these folders** section, select **Add a folder**, in the **Folder** box, type **C:\\Reports**, select **Choose this folder**, and then close the **Settings** window.
    
6.  In the **File History** window**,** in the **File History is on** section, select **Run now**.
    
7.  In File Explorer, in the details pane, right-click **Report.txt**, select **Properties**, select the **Previous Versions** tab, verify that there is now one previous version, and then select **OK**.
    
8.  In the navigation pane, right-click **Data**, select **Properties**, select the **Previous Versions** tab, and then select **Data** in the **Folder versions** section.
    
9.  Select the arrow near the **Restore** button, and then verify that you can restore the previous version either to the original location or to a custom location.
    
10. In the **Data Properties** dialog box, select the arrow near the **Open** button, and then select **Open in File History**.
    
11. In the Data – File History window, on the left of the address box, select the upward-pointing arrow once. Notice that File History is protecting the Data and Reports folders, in addition to the Users folder, which is protected by default.
    
12. In the C:\\ - File History window, select the upward-pointing arrow again to view all folders and libraries that File History is protecting.
    
13. Close the Home – File History window, in the **Data Properties** dialog box, select **OK**.

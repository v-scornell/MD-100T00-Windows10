# Practice Lab: Deploying Windows Desktop settings using a provisioning package

## Summary

In this lab, you identify the tools included in the Windows ADK, install the Configuration Designer component of the Windows ADK, create a provisioning package, and then deploy the configuration package to a Windows 11 desktop device.

### Scenario

As part of the Desktop Administration team at Contoso, you have been tasked with deploying new Windows 11 desktop devices to users. The devices have been purchased with Windows 11 pre-installed. You need to use the Configuration Designer to create a provisioning package that applies the following settings on the new devices:

- A device name in the format of **SEA-CL%RAND:2%**, which specifies SEA-CL with two random numbers.
- Join the device to the Contoso.com Active Directory domain.
- Create a local administrator account with the name LocalAdmin with the password of Pa55w.rd.
- Install two applications named PowerToys and  Power BI Desktop to the device.

### Task 1: Identify the Windows ADK tools

1. Sign in to SEA-SVR2 as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. On the taskbar, select **Start** and then select **Control Panel**.

3. Select **Programs**, and then select **Programs and Features**. 

    > Notice that the **Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit** and the **Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit Windows Preinstallation Environment Add-ons** programs are installed.

4. Select **Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit** and then select **Change**.

5. On the **Maintain your Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit features** page, ensure that **Change** is selected and then select **Next**.

6. Notice the features that have been installed on SEA-SVR2. Features include:
    - Deployment Tools

    - User State Migration Tool (USMT)

    - Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) Template

      > Notice that Configuration Designer is not installed.

7. Select the check box next to **Configuration Designer**, and then select **Change**.

8. On the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit window, select **Close**.

9. Close the **Programs and Features** window.

### Task 2: Create a provisioning package

1. On SEA-SVR2, select **Start**, expand **Windows Kits**, and then select **Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer**. 

   > The **Windows Configuration Designer** opens at the **Start page**.

2. On the **Start page**, select **Provision desktop devices**. The **New project** window opens.

3. In the **New project** window, under **Name**, type **Windows 11 Provision Package**.

4. Under **Description**, type the following:
   - Assigns a device name in the format of SEA-CL%RAND:2%. Joins the device to Contoso.com. Creates a local administrator account with the name LocalAdmin with the password of Pa55w.rd, and adds an application named PowerToys to the device.

5. Select **Finish**. A new page named **Windows 11 Provision Package** displays with several configuration steps.

6. On the **Set up Device** step, configure the following setting:
   - Under **Device name**, type **SEA-CL%RAND:2%**.

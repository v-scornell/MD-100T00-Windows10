## Lab Setup

### Task 1: Simulate the issue

1. Sign in to **SEA-SVR2** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. Open **File Explorer** and then browse to **E:\\Labfiles\\Mod07**.

3. Run the **E:\\Labfiles\\Mod07\\Lab.cmd** script.

## Exercise 1: Resolving file permissions

### Scenario

Users in the Marketing department have a data folder to which they should have exclusive access.  

Alice Ciccu, a member of the Marketing department, reports that non-Marketing users have access to Marketing data in the **\\\\SEA-SVR2\\Marketing** shared folder. 

Mike Ray, a member of the IT department, reports that he can review and open files in the Marketing share, but cannot modify the files in this share.

You need to investigate and ensure that only members of the Marketing department can access the **\\\\SEA-SVR2\\Marketing** shared folder.

### Task 1: Validate the issue

1. Sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\Mike** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. From the taskbar, open the **File Explorer**.

3. In File Explorer, in the address bar, enter **\\\\SEA-SVR2\\Marketing**, and then select **Enter**.

4. In the details pane, open **Report**, and then verify that it opens in Notepad.

5. In Notepad, enter your name. Select **File**, select **Save**, select **Report**, select **Save**, and then select **Yes**.

   > You will receive a message that indicates “You do not have permission to open this file”, because Mike is not in the Marketing group and he cannot modify the files.

6. In the message select **OK**, close **Notepad**, and then select **Don’t Save**.

   > Mike is not in the Marketing group, so you should not be able to access the share. However, you were able to open share content. You need to diagnose and correct this improper configuration.

7. Close File Explorer and sign out of SEA-CL1.

### Task 2: Resolve the issue

1. Users who are not members of the Marketing group should not be able to access the Marketing share. Attempt to resolve the problem by using your knowledge of file permissions and shared folder access.

    > You need to ensure that only Marketing users from offices in Seattle and London should be able to modify the file. Therefore, you must not remove the condition, but extend it to include Marketing users from London.

13. In File Explorer, in the navigation pane, right-click **Collected** or activate its context menu, and then select **Properties**. 

14. Select the **Security** tab, and then select **Advanced**.

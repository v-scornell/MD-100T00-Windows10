# Practice Lab: Managing Windows Update Settings

## Summary

In this lab you manage Windows Update settings for a single device and configure feature and quality update settings for multiple devices using Windows Update for Business Group Policy settings.

## Exercise 1: Configuring Windows Update for a Single Device

### Scenario

You need to validate the Windows Update settings for SEA-WS3. You have also been asked to ensure that the following Windows update settings are applied to the device:

- Updates for other Microsoft products should be enabled.
- A notification must be shown when the device requires a restart to finish updating.
- Delivery optimization must be configured to allow downloads from the internet and the local network.
- Active hours should be configured to be 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM.
- Updates should be paused for 2 weeks.

## Exercise 2: Managing Feature and Quality Updates with Windows Update for Business

### Scenario

Contoso uses Windows Update for Business to manage the updates for Windows 10 devices.

You have been delegated the task to create Group Policy Objects to configure Windows Update for Business for your Windows 10 devices. Your first task is to determine how many deployment rings you will need and the associated Windows update settings based upon business requirements. You then need to configure a Group Policy object for each deployment ring. The Group Policy Objects will then be linked to organizational units by the Active Directory administrators at a later time.

### Task 1: Identify Windows Update for Business Requirements

Contoso currently configures each Windows 10 device to apply Windows updates based upon manual operating system settings. However a number of issues have come up that requires you to revisit and propose a new solution:

- Updates are not fully tested before they are installed on the all the computers in the organization. This is especially troublesome for when a new feature update is released.
- Some users have been pausing updates for an extended period of time.
- Some users have been enrolling into the Windows Insider Program, which has caused compatibility issues for some of the devices.
- It is difficult to maintain and manage the Windows 10 update settings using the current manual process.

You have been asked to address these issues by:

- Ensuring that updates are tested at least 10 days before being deployed to everyone in the organization.
- Restricting standard users from configuring Windows Update settings.
- Implementing Windows Update for Business.

You need to develop a plan to implement Windows Update for Business. Consider the following questions to help you with your solution:

1. How will you ensure that an update has been tested properly before being deployed throughout the entire organization? *Answer: Create Active Directory Group Policy Objects that align with deployment rings. One possible solution is to create a pilot deployment ring that does not defer quality or feature updates. This will allow any device that has this policy to immediately obtain a released update and start its testing process. A second Broad deployment ring can be created that has a deferral for 10 days for both quality and feature updates. This second object would be applied to the rest of the organization and will not receive released updates until 10 days have passed.*
2. How will you ensure that standard users are restricted from configuring Windows Updates? *Answer: Using Group Policy settings will provide the ability to restrict various settings such as pausing updates and enrolling into the Windows Insiders Program.*
3. How will you manage and maintain Windows Updates for your organization? *Answer: Windows Update for Business uses Active Directory Group Policy. For more granular control and management, Microsoft Intune or Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager can also be used.*

### Task 2: Use Group Policy to configure Windows Update for Business

# Practice Lab: Managing password and account options

## Summary

In this lab you create and manage domain password policies, account options, and User Account Control.

## Exercise 1: Managing Domain Password Policies

### Scenario

You have been delegated the task to configure the domain password policy for Contoso.com. Part of your task is to implement a new security requirement that specifies a longer password and a 20 minute account lockout if a user incorrectly enters their password more than three times in succession.

*Note: You will use SEA-SVR1 which includes all Windows Administrative Tools for remotely managing SEA-DC1 and to perform Active Directory management tasks.*

12. Double-click the **Account lockout threshold** policy.

13. In the **Account lockout threshold Properties** dialog box, set the **Account will lock out after** setting to **3** invalid logon attempts, and then select **OK**.

14. Close the **Group Policy Management Editor**.

15. Close the **Group Policy Management console**.

16. In Server Manager, in the **Tools** list, select **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

17. Expand the **Contoso.com** node, and then select the **IT** OU.

18. Right-click the **Jane Dow** user account, and then select **Properties**.

19. In the **Jane Dow Properties** dialog box, select the **Account** tab.

20. In the list of **Account Options**, clear the **Password never expires** check box, and then select the **User must change password at next logon** check box. select **OK**.

### Task 2: Refresh GPOs

1. On SEA-SVR1, right-click **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.

2. In the Administrator: Windows PowerShell window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
    Invoke-Gpupdate -force
```

3. Close the **Active Directory Users and Computers** and the **Windows PowerShell** window.

**Results**: After completing this exercise you created a password policy that will affect the password settings for all domain users.

## Exercise 2: Testing Password Policy Settings

### Scenario

After configuring a more strict set of password policies you will then ask Jane Dow to test the policy settings.

### Task 1: Verify password settings

1. Switch to **SEA-CL1** and sign in as **Contoso\\Jane** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. When the message appears that indicates the user’s password must be changed before signing in, select **OK**.

3. In the New password box and the Confirm password box, type **Pa55w.rd12**, and then press **Enter**.

4. When the message displays that indicates that the new password does not meet the length, complexity, or history requirements of the domain, select **OK**. Type the old password, **Pa55w.rd**.

5. In the New password box and the Confirm password box, type **Pa55w.rd1234**, and then press **Enter**.

6. When a message displays that indicates that the password has been changed, select **OK**. Wait as the user profile is created for Jane.

7. Sign out of **SEA-CL1**.

### Task 2: Attempt repeated sign-ins

1. Attempt to sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\Jane** with the incorrect password **password1**.

2. When a message displays that indicates that the password is incorrect, select **OK**.

3. Attempt again to sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\Jane** with the incorrect password **password1**.

4. When a message displays that indicates that the password is incorrect, select **OK**.

5. Attempt again to sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\Jane** with the incorrect password **password1**.

6. When the message displays that indicates that the referenced account is locked out, select **OK**.

### Task 3: Unlock a locked account

1. Switch to **SEA-SVR1**.

2. On SEA-SVR1, in Server Manager, in the **Tools** list, select **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

3. Expand the **Contoso.com** node, and then select the **IT** OU.

4. Right-click the **Jane Dow** user account, and then select **Properties**.

5. In the **Jane Dow Properties** dialog box, select the **Account** tab.

6. Select the check box next to **Unlock account**. This account is currently locked out on this Active Directory Domain Controller.

7. Select **OK** to close the **Jane Dow Properties** box.

8. Close **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

**Results**: After completing this exercise you verified that the password policy works as expected.

## Exercise 3: Configuring UAC

### Scenario

You need to configure UAC so that when the UAC dialog box prompts a standard user, he or she can enter the credentials of an administrator account to gain elevated privileges. You also need to restrict the execution of unsigned applications.

10. Close the **Local Group Policy Editor**.

11. Sign out of **SEA-CL1**.

### Task 2: Test the UAC prompts as a standard user

1. Sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\Jon** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. Select **Start**, and then enter **Windows PowerShell**.  

3. Under **Windows PowerShell**, select **Run as administrator**.

   _**Note**: The Windows operating system displays the User Account Control prompt._

4. In the **User name** box, type **Administrator**, and in the **Password** box, type **Pa55w.rd**, and then select **Yes**.

5. Close the **Windows PowerShell** window.

6. Sign out of **SEA-CL1**.

### Task 3: Verify the UAC notifications as an administrator

1. Sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

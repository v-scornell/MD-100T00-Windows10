## Summary

In this exercise you configure File History and use it to restore previous versions of a file or folder.

## Exercise 1: Configuring File History

### Scenario

You need to ensure that users can recover deleted files stored in the Documents library on their local workstations. You decide to validate the File History feature using SEA-CL2. You will first create a shared folder on SEA-SVR1 named FileHistory to be used as a central storage location. You will then configure the File History feature on SEA-CL2 to store file history data.

1. Sign in to **SEA-SVR1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. From the taskbar, select **File Explorer** and in the navigation pane, select **Local Disk (C:)**.

3. In File Explorer, in the details pane, right-click an empty space, point to **New**, and then select **Folder**. Type **FileHistory** as the folder name, and then press **Enter**.

4. Right-click the **FileHistory** folder, and then select **Properties**.

5. In the **FileHistory Properties** dialog box, on the **Security** tab, select **Edit**. Select **Add**, in the **Enter the object names to select** box, type **Domain Users**, and then select **OK**.

A request has been made to use File History to protect two custom folders on SEA-CL2 named Data and Reports.  Both folders need to be added to the Documents library to be protected by File History.

### Task 1: Configure the lab environment

# Practice Lab: Administering Windows Client Using Remote Management

## Summary

In this lab you perform remote Windows administration using Remote PowerShell, Remote Desktop, and Windows Admin Center.

## Exercise 1: Administering Windows using Remote PowerShell and Remote Desktop

### Scenario

Contoso is planning to open a new branch office. To manage the devices in the new branch office you need to use Remote PowerShell and Remote Desktop. You need to test remote administration by running remote PowerShell commands on SEA-SVR2 and you need to enable Remote Desktop on SEA-CL1.

### Task 1: Perform remote management using Windows PowerShell

1. Sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password: **Pa55w.rd**.

2. Select **Start**, and then type **PowerShell**.

3. Under the Windows PowerShell app, select **Run as Administrator**.

4. To view all of the services that are stopped on SEA-SVR2, in the Windows PowerShell window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
Get-Service -ComputerName SEA-SVR2 | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Stopped"}
```

4. To view the the content of the C:\\Program Files folder on SEA-SVR2, in the Windows PowerShell window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
Invoke-Command -ComputerName SEA-SVR2 -ScriptBlock {Get-ChildItem "C:\Program Files"}
```

5. To view the the System event log on SEA-SVR2, in the Windows PowerShell window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
Invoke-Command –ComputerName SEA-SVR2 –ScriptBlock {Get-EventLog –log system}
```

6. To determine if the WinRM service is running on SEA-SVR2, in the Windows PowerShell window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
Test-WsMan SEA-SVR2
```

   *Note: The output on SEA-SVR2 validates that the WinRM service is running and it is ready to receive WS-Management requests. If it was not configured, you would have needed to run **Winrm quickconfig** on SEA-SVR2.*

7. In the Windows PowerShell window, type the following commands, and then press **Enter** after each one:

```
Enter-PSSession SEA-SVR2
Get-command
Add-Content Remote.txt "Adding text to file on SEA-SVR2"
Exit-PSSession
```

# Practice Lab: Monitoring Events using Event Viewer

## Summary

In this lab, you manage Windows event logs and configure Event log subscriptions.

## Exercise 1: Manage Windows Event Logs

### Scenario

You need to identify and review any system errors reported on SEA-CL1. You will use Event Viewer to review the event log entries for the Application, Security, and System logs, and filter out the Warning and Error events. You will then configure the Maximum log size for the Application and System event logs. Finally, you will configure the Security event log to Archive the log when full and do not overwrite events.

### Task 1: Review Event Log entries

1. Sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password: **Pa55w.rd**.

2. Select **Start**, and then type **Event Viewer**.

3. In the search results, select the **Event Viewer** app. The Event Viewer opens.

4. Maximize the Event Viewer window.

5. Under Event Viewer (Local), expand **Windows Logs**.

6. Under Windows Logs, select **Application** and then scroll through the reported events. Take note of the various events listed for the Application log. You may have a combination of Information, Warning, and Error events.

7. Under Windows Logs, select **Security** and then scroll through the reported events. Take note of the events listed for the Security log. Most of these events are security related based upon Microsoft Windows security auditing.

8. Under Windows Logs, select **System** and then scroll through the reported events. Take note of the various events listed for the System log. You may have a combination of Information, Warning, and Error events related to internal Windows system services.

9. With the **System** log selected, in the Actions pane select **Filter Current Log**.

10. In the Filter Current Log dialog box, on the Filter tab, next to Event level, select the check box next to **Warning** and select the check box next to **Error**.

11. Select **OK** to return to the System log events. Notice that only Warning and Error events are now displayed, since you have filtered out the Information events.

12. In the Actions pane, select **Clear Filter**. All System events are now displayed.

13. Select the **Application** log, and then in the Actions pane select **Filter Current Log**.

14. In the Filter Current Log dialog box, on the Filter tab, next to Event level, select the check box next to **Warning** and select the check box next to **Error**.

15. Select **OK** to return to the Application log events. Review the filtered events.

16. In the Actions pane, select **Clear Filter**.

17. In the navigation pane, expand **Applications and Services Logs**. These logs relate to specific services or applications installed on the local machine.

18. Under Applications and Services Logs, expand **Microsoft**, and then expand **Windows**. Notice the variety of log information related to Windows features and services.

19. Under the Windows node, expand **GroupPolicy** and then select the **Operational** log. Take note of the various events listed for the Group Policy Operational log. You may have a combination of Information, Warning, and Error events related to Group Policy processing for the local machine.

20. In the navigation pane, close the **Applications and Services Logs** branch.

### Task 2: Configure Event Log Properties

1. Under Windows Logs, select **Application** and then in the Actions pane, select **Properties**.

2. In the Log Properties - Application dialog box, on the General tab, change the **Maximum log size (KB)** to **2048**.

3. On the General tab, select **Clear log** and then in the Event Viewer prompt select **Clear**.

4. Select **OK** to close the Log Properties - Application dialog box.

5. Under Windows Logs, select **Security** and then in the Actions pane, select **Properties**.

6. In the Log Properties - Security dialog box, on the General tab, change the **Maximum log size (KB)** to **30464**.

7. Under When maximum event log size is reached, select **Archive the log when full, do not overwrite events**.

8. Select **OK** to close the Log Properties - Security dialog box.

9. Close the Event Viewer.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have successfully reviewed event log entries and configured property settings for event logs.

## Exercise 2: Configure and Manage Event Subscriptions  

### Scenario

SEA-CL2 is a critical workstation that needs to be monitored and maintained on a regular basis. To efficiently monitor SEA-CL2, you decide to collect its event log entries so that you can review them on your workstation named SEA-CL1. To perform this task, you need to assign permissions on SEA-CL2. You will then create a "Collector Initiated" event log subscription on your workstation that connects to SEA-CL2 and collects the last 30 days of event log entries.

### Task 1: Configure Event Log Subscriptions

1. Sign in to **SEA-CL2** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. Right-click **Start**, and then select **Windows Terminal (Admin)**.

3. At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
winrm quickconfig
```

4. At the PowerShell command type **Y** when prompted. You will be prompted to configure the WinRM service and the WinRM firewall exception.

5. Close Windows PowerShell.

6. Right-click **Start**, and then select **Computer Management**.

7. Expand **System Tools**, expand **Local Users and Groups**, and then select **Groups**.

10. In the **Object Types** dialog box, select the **Computers** check box, and then select **OK**.

11. In the **Select Users, Computers, Service Accounts, or Groups** dialog box, in the **Enter the object names to select (examples)** box, type **SEA-CL1**, and then select **OK**.

12. In the **Event Log Readers Properties** dialog box, select **OK**.

13. Close the **Computer Management** window.

14. Switch to **SEA-CL1** and, if necessary, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

15. Right-click **Start**, and then select **Windows Terminal (Admin)**.

16. At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
wecutil qc
```

17. When prompted, type **Y**, and then press **Enter**.

18. Close the Windows PowerShell window.

### Task 2: View and filter events

1. On **SEA-CL1**, right-click **Start**, and then select **Event Viewer**. Maximize the Event Viewer window.
